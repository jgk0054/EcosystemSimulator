# EcosystemSimulator

This is a very basic unity game that I intend to use to simulate a very basic ecosystem model.
The twist is that I am looking to create a behavioural model for 'animals' in this ecosystem that
simulates natural selection, with behavioural charecteristics that change over time based on selective pressures
in the envoirnment. Sort of a 'Can I make natural selection work in the context of a minimalistic ecosystem simulation?'
thing.
